# Learning Computer Science

This repository carries code and other resources I use to learn Computer Science.

## [Parallel Computing](./parallel)

Parallel programming and Distributed Computation. Things like OpenMP and PThreads.

To run OpenMP code:
```
gcc -fopenmp <source_file> -o <output_file>
```

To run PThreads code:
```
gcc -lpthread <source_file> -o <output_file>
```


## [Algorithms](./algorithms)

Basic and classic algorithms in CS.
